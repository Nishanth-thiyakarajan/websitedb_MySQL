 This Project consists of website Data.  I have used advanced sql concepts for querying the database and get the insights to solve the queries raised from the business perspective.

This database consists of 6 tables, 145 columns, 51 indexes, 6 triggers, 7 views and 3 stored Procedures.

I am attaching the ER Diagram to view the dataase and also the connections between the tables so that you can understand the database better.
